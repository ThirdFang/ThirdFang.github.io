		<p>Hello, and welcome to my personal portfolio. My name is Cary Vailes, and as of now, I'm an amateur Programmer and Web Developer. My dream for the future, aside from improving my current set of skills to a professional level, is to one day study and earn a degree in game design, and enter the game industry as an animator. Other than that, I'm just a real cool guy trying to find new ways to entertain myself. Pleased to meet you!</p>

		<h2>A Little About Myself</h2>

		<p class="indent">Since graduating from Penn State Wilkes-Barre with my Bachelor of Science degree in <abbr title="Information Science & Technology">IST</abbr>, I've begun the process of gaining work experience. From my brief internship as an IT Representative at a restaurant, to working for the State of Texas as a Java prgrammer, I figure I've been doing decently well. As of writing this, I have intermediate knowledge of <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</abbr>, as well as a basic understanding of Java (primarily for android application development).</p>

		<p class="indent">As I mentioned in the opening, I want to study and design video games, hopefully in the near future. This determination started back on my 9<sup>th</sup> birthday, when I received my first gaming console and video game (original Xbox and <i>Start Wars: Knights of the Old Republic</i>). I must have put a month's worth of time playing it, exploring multiple paths, story lines, moral choices, play styles, equipment combinations, team balance, etc. When I done all that I could do at the time, I knew what I wanted to do when I grew up: to design video games. It wasn't until high school where I realized what facet of game design I wanted to do, that being animation (I figured that If I studied animation and couldn't make it in the game industry, I could still use animation as another career path). My goal is to go back to school to study game design and animation (possibly art if that I need too), and eventually earn a degree in that field</p>

		<p class="indent">When I'm not working, studying, dreaming, or scheming, I'm pretty much chilling and loafing about. Most of my free time is spent either playing on the PS4 (love it or hate it, I believe it has some of the best exclusive games), making and assembling handles for knives (will probably make <a href="http://www.elementalforge.com/5160Club/HowToMakeAStockRemovalWorkingKnife.pdf" target="_blank" class="hvr-pulse internal"> stock removal knives</a> in the future), creating car decals through media on the internet (specializing in video games, anime, and internet memes), and messing around with my cat CC (Crazy Cat/Cary's Cat, depending who you ask). </p>

		<h2>Who Doesn't Like Pictures?</h2>

		<p class="indent">Seriously, who doesn't like pictures? Here, you can see moments in my past...at least as far back as college. In the future, this will be filled out with works I've developed or assisted in, replacing the current content (I know, you'll miss my ugly mug, and it will be a sad say indeed when it leaves this page). So for now, enjoy the gloriousness that is me, myself, and I!</p>

			<p class="indent">As with everything, we have reached the end. To those that managed to get this far, Congratulations! You've done the impossible and survived my insanity. Though there are no prizes for making it this far, I commend you for your efforts. So, should you feel the need to contact me, you can share any questions, comments, concerns, complaints, frustrations, irritations, aggravations, insinuations, grievances, allegations, accusations, contemplations, consternations, and inputs at <a href="mailto:caryvailes@hotmail.com?subject=Comment(s) For Your Website" class="hvr-pulse internal">caryvailes@hotmail.com</a>. Or you can just say hi...I'll answer those as well (Gives me something to do, right?).</p>

			<p class="indent">While there are no prizes, I would feel bad if you left this page without having something to entertain you. So, here's a video from the recent 2018 commercial lineup. Witness greatness as we see Peter Dinklage (literally) spitting fire to Busta Rhymes's verse from Chris Brown's "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gyLR4NfMiI" target="_blank" class="hvr-pulse internal">Look At Me Now</a>", against Morgan Freeman's <i>chilling</i> performance of Missy Elliott's "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPoKiGQzbSQ" target="_blank" class="hvr-pulse internal">Get Ur Freak On</a>". Let the epic showdown between the greats commence!</p>
