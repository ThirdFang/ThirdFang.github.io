		<p>Hello, and welcome to my personal portfolio. My name is Cary Vailes, and I'm an amateur Programmer and Web Developer. My dream for the future, aside from improving my current set of skills to a professional level, is to one day study and earn a degree in game design, and enter the game industry as an animator. Other than that, I'm just a real cool guy trying to find new ways to entertain myself. Pleased to meet you!</p>

		<h2>A Little About Myself</h2>

		<p class="indent">Shortly after graduating high school, I went to Penn State Wilkes-Barre to study Information Science & Technology, with the sole purpose being, "If I'm gonna try to go into an industry where I'll be on a computer most of the time, I might as well get a degree understanding them". Turns out, writing code is both calming and fun (so long as said code has no errors. Finding errors without the aid of a program is a nightmare). Since graduating from Penn State with my Bachelor of Science degree in <abbr title="Information Science & Technology">IST</abbr>, I've begun the process of gaining work experience. From my brief internship as an IT Representative at a restaurant, to working for <abbr title="Texas Department of Criminal Justice">TDCJ</abbr> as a Java prgrammer, I figure I've been doing decently well. As of writing this, I have intermediate knowledge of <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</abbr>, as well as a basic understanding of Java (primarily for android application development).</p>

		<p class="indent">As I mentioned in the opening, I want to study and design video games, hopefully in the near future. This determination started back on my 9<sup>th</sup> birthday, when I received my first gaming console and video game (original Xbox and <i>Start Wars: Knights of the Old Republic</i>). I must have put a month's worth of time playing it, exploring multiple paths, story lines, moral choices, play styles, equipment combinations, team balance, etc. When I done all that I could do at the time, I knew what I wanted to do when I grew up: to design video games. It wasn't until high school where I realized what facet of game design I wanted to do, that being animation (I figured that If I studied animation and couldn't make it in the game industry, I could still use animation as another career path). My goal is to go back to school to study game design and animation (possibly art if that I need too), and eventually earn a degree in that field</p>

		<p class="indent">When I'm not working, studying, or making my plans for world domination, I'm typically at home hanging out. That normally includes, but certainly not limited to: playing and understanding video games (mostly on the PS4. Love it or hate it, it has some of the best exclusive games...and that's coming from someone supported Microsoft/Xbox for over 7 years), making and assembling knives (I plan on making <a href="http://www.elementalforge.com/5160Club/HowToMakeAStockRemovalWorkingKnife.pdf" target="_blank" class="hvr-pulse internal">stock removal knives</a>), creating car decals through media from the internet (specializing in video games, anime, and internet memes), and spoiling my my cat CC. I'm also planning on setting some time aside to dig into my list of subjects that I've always wanted to learn.</p>

In the future, I hope to fill this gallery/slideshow with projects that I've worked on or assisted in, allowing viewers to see how they function and/or what they do. Until then, you're stuck staring at my handsome mug. Enjoy!</p>

			<p class="indent">While there are no prizes, I would feel bad if you left this page without having something to entertain you. So, here's a video from the recent 2018 commercial lineup. Witness greatness as we see Peter Dinklage (literally) spitting fire to Busta Rhymes's verse from Chris Brown's "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gyLR4NfMiI" target="_blank" class="hvr-pulse internal">Look At Me Now</a>", against Morgan Freeman's <i>chilling</i> performance of Missy Elliott's "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPoKiGQzbSQ" target="_blank" class="hvr-pulse internal">Get Ur Freak On</a>". Let the epic showdown between the greats commence!</p>
