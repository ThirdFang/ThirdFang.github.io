/* This function is used for providing quotes once the "More Quotes, Please" button from the index is clicked. One array (quotes) holds all the quotes, while the other (usedQuotes) is the container for used quotes. Once a quote has been displayed, it will move into the usedQuotes array, until all quotes have been used. Once all quotes have been used and moved to the usedQuotes array, the IF statement activates, and copies all the quotes from the usedQuotes array to the quotes array, and then makes the usedQuotes array empty again. The quotes are displayed randomly from the quotes array. There is a chance (that decreases with each new addition to the quotes array) that a quote can be displayed twice   */
